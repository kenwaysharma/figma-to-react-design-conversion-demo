## How does the app function?
- In the url at `/market`, there is a stepper which on completing, enables the "Complete" button adjacent to "Themse Park Site" title.
- If the checkbox is unchecked and user tries to complete it, the whole box highlights with red color indicating an error.
- When the checbox is checked and the user hits on "Complete" button of the particular step, it completes and moves onto the next step.
- When all the steps are completed with the same process the main "Complete" button gets enabled. On clicking it the user goes onto the next main step (Next main step to "Choose your new site")
